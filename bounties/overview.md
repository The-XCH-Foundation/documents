# Chia Bounty System:

## Roles

Starting off with a bit of an obvious thing, but hey, there are 2 main roles in a bounty system:

1.  *Bounty Hunter* - Completes tasks given by the Offerer in exchange for rewards
    
2.  *Bounty Offerer* - Offers rewards in exchange for tasks completed

Most of the time, if the bounty terms are clear enough, the third role of moderator usually isn't necessary.

The transaction is processed, and both parties have what they wanted. It's simple enough for now to have one of the founding members moderate claims or claim disputes in the meantime, if they present.

## Bounty types:

**Gated Bounty**

Requires bounty Offerer approval before beginning tasks. Single hunter submits qualifications, then does tasks.

**Single Bounty**

Any hunter can claim the full bounty reward as soon as it is active, if not claimed already by another.

**Campaign Bounty**

Different hunters can claim the same reward amount from the same bounty fund, up to the funded amount.

**Competitive Bounty**

Multiple claims, only one(or gold, silver, bronze?) is chosen to be rewarded out of a pool of claims.

<br>
Some bounty types do really well for certain kinds of projects. A campaign bounty, for instance, would be great for bounties involving some kind of community engagement, or voting on a community issue. A Competitive Bounty might discourage some from doing the work upfront, but could be great for a hackathon.

## Bounty Reward types:

XCH, community CATs, other?

<br>

## Bounty Timeframes:

Some are only active until a claim is accepted, some are active until the funds are used.
<br>
<br>
## How does the process work?

**First, a bounty Offerer signs up:**

1.  Adds their profile and wallet details, complete KYC?
    
2.  Transfers funds to user wallet, or bounty escrow wallet.
    
3.  Creates a bounty, filling in details like:

		Project Name, Offerer details, Deliverables, Timeframe, Funding etc

5.  Releases the funds, submits the bounty for approval
    
6.  Bounty is posted
    

  

**Once the bounty is posted, any site visitor can search for them, filtering by certain rules, like:**

	type, skills required, reward amount / currency, keywords, reputation, project name, company

  
  

**You can then look in-depth at a bounty:**

	Terms, Offerer bounties paid history, feedback, favorited by __ hunters, etc

**Then, if you're logged in, you can communicate interest:**

	Contact Offerer, save to user profile 'favorites'
	
<br>
<br>

So, is it your bounty now? Depending on the bounty type, you might have to wait for their submission to be reviewed. If it's a 'gated' bounty, you can now begin communicating with the Offerer. Only after the Offerer approves you for the task should you begin the task. After completing work, you'll still need to submit proof of finishing the tasks before finally claiming the reward.

## User Profiles

For a Hunter, having a personal profile will really help to show off their accomplishments, get better responses from Offerers, and participate in community events while displaying their CATs or other bounty hunter rewards.

**Itâ€™s a customizable user profile, with a few added details:**

-   User profile or public profile - photo, short bio/intro, completed bounties + reviews, badges, CATs, Membership
    
-   Active bounties - inbox, contact active bounty Offerer, submit work + request payment, request moderator help
    
-   Setup/Review wallet + transactions, review reward/community CATs
    
-   Community events they've signed up for, notifications

**And for Offerers, all the same as with a Hunter, but with:**

-   Open/Offered Bounties - direct message hunter, withdraw bounty, confirm bounty as completed + payout, request moderator help

<br>
<br>

## Community

A bounty hunter could be interested in bounties for social media work, software engineering, or language translation.

We make it a rewarding experience beyond just a XCH or CAT reward for a bounty claimed, by adding community perks and special rewards for being a contributing member.

It's important that hunters feel rewarded for sticking around instead of hopping from bounty system to bounty system. There is a need for both quality bounty creators and quality bounty hunters --- each counts on the other one to be there when joining the bounty system.
<br>
***A good bounty system recognizes and rewards healthy community involvement and helps users identify good actors in the hunter/offerer pool.***
<br>
**Both bounty Hunters and bounty Offerers provide long-term value to the Chia community, by:**

-   Approving a claim on a bounty, and claiming a bounty reward.
    
-   Offering a bounty and paying it -in full- quickly, upon completion.
    
-   Earning and using community CATs, NFTs, or even plotting/farming/harvesting/holding some XCH.
    
-   Completing multiple bounties with good Offerer feedback.
    
-   Sharing feedback about unclear bounties, or bounty Offerers and Hunters that are inappropriate or abuse community rules.

**So for their hard work, beyond just the bounty rewards, a good bounty system rewards them with things like:**

  

-   Community recommendations or positive reputation for bounties completed / bounties paid in full.
    
-   Having your work or hunter/creator profile displayed in competitive lists
    
-   Access to exclusive bounties.
    
-   Community perks: community CATs, NFTs, access to developer events, access to streams/AMAs etc, guild memberships, training, etc.
    
-   First group to receive notice of the bounty before posting publicly, or increased visibility in an Offerers inbox.
    

  

*NOTE: I'm not a tax guy, but in the US wouldn't KYC be required for bounties over a certain value threshold? Having some sort of KYC verified badge for accounts in that case could be helpful.*
