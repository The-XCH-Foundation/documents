# Scalable Community and Donations Structure:

## Objective:
A community focused on expanding the utility and adoption of the Chia^tm^ blockchain.
This is achieved by developing ChiaLisp toolsets, distributing educational materials, and crowdfunding for members participation.  

## Roles:
Officer , Lead, Member

### Members
Everyone starts as a member, membership is granted through the completion of bounties. Bounties are converted or combined into projects.

Members receive 2 member tokens.

### Leads
Leads volunteer to manage projects and are approved by project team members (some initial teams may consist of only one member and that member will be the Lead). Leads can be substituted or supplemented when necessary or voted upon by full majority of project members (votes can be overturned by Officers).

Leads receive 3 member tokens

### Officers
Officers are elected by simple majority of members at predefined intervals (first officers may be appointed by founders for a term of 1 year).

Officers receive 5 member tokens

## Concept:
Bounties -> projects, bounty winners -> members, members -> Leads & Officers

As bounties are fulfilled, similar bounties will be combined into projects with the submitting members joining a development team to continue developing their own projects with some help or to combine bounty submissions and work with each other on a combined project.

During this process the creators and leads of projects are identified (these may or may not be the same member). If submissions are maintained separately but are similar in scope than a Lead may still be designated and the continued progress will be maintained as a single project with multiple iterations. This is distinguished for project based funding to be partially allocated to the creator.

Leads are volunteers that must first be approved by the Officers and project team (Officers will ensure that projects are within the community scope and guidelines). Leads have the responsibilities of defining project goals, providing progress updates, partnering with other team Leads, and maintaining team relations.
Officers are elected by a simple majority of members for a predefined term. The Founders may act as or appoint the initial Officers for a term of no more than 1 year. Officers have the responsibilities of defining department goals, providing progress updates, partnering with other Officers, and maintaining department relations.
