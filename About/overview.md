# Overview of The XCH Foundation

***

## Vision

A decentralized developer community focused on building ChiaLisp based blockchain tools and projects, expanding utility within Proof-of-Space-Time blockchains, and compensating members with publicly verifyable mechanisms.

## Goals

1. Launching The XCH Foundation
2. Expanding to 500 members
3. Developing ChiaLisp training and educational material
4. Releasing tools for PoST blockchains (plot managers, offline signing tools, etc)
5. Releasing projects for PoST blockchains (auxilary applications, nodes, etc)
6. Evolving the community into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

## About the Founders

ClydeWallace22 (Brandt) -

With 12 years experience leading teams in high-tech industries; Clyde is passionate about creating robust organizational frameworks that are sustainable, efficient, and value driven. Clyde has administered a $5 billion budget with Charter Communications, written FCC whitepapers to define broadband propagation mapping standards, and spoken as the legislative expert on a Durango Tech-Knowledge UAV (Drone) panel. Clyde's background working within diverse industries alongside governments, consumers, and developers enables him to establish organizational structures that enhance associate engagement, ensure sustainability, and encourage community involvement.

Clyde began following the Chia Network^tm^ shortly before transactions went live on mainnet and quickly began farming 175TB. To better understand ChiaLisp, the on-chain programming language, Clyde developed the Rhizosphere IDE. Rhizosphere is an open-source python based IDE for which Clyde was a finalist in the Sirius Labs hackathon. Most recently Clyde has been working as the Chief Operating Officer of xch.gallery, the first NFT marketplace live on Chia Testnet10.

It is Clyde's vision that The XCH Foundation evolves to become fully operated and managed by the community. The Foundation ideally will develop open source tooling, educational materials, and industry partnerships to expand the utility of ChiaLisp based Proof-of-Space-Time blockchains. Clyde believes the adaptable framework he developed for The Foundation ensures this vision and lays the groundwork for advancing utility within the ecosystem. Clyde can be reached on Discord, Keybase, Twitter, and Github.

## XCH Foundation Overview

The XCH Foundation is designed as a flat organization with a focus on attracting new members, encouraging current member participation, and eliciting community feedback. The Foundation structure will consist of three layers: members, leads, and officer.

To become a member, users must complete an approved proof-of-human-work (PoH) activity. Initial PoH activities will consist of bounties designed to attract developers, designers, community managers, operations leaders, etc. Members will be responsible for working on community tools, projects, and educational materials. During the first year, The Foundation will operate in a trusted setup phase during which the Founders will approve members and appoint leadership.

After the first year, leads will be elected by members using decentralized voting mechanisms secured by the Chia blockchain.  Leads will be responsible for overseeing project completion, incentivizing members, and recommended new projects to be completed. One lead may responsible for multiple projects or there may be multiple leads associated with a single project. Leads will be elected from all divisions (developers, designers, community managers, etc) and will rewarded with additional voting rights and compensation.

After the first year, officers will be elected by the members using a decentralized voting mechanisms secured by the Chia blockchain. Officers will be responsible for overseeing the direction of The Foundation, incentivising leads, and interacting with other organizations in the ecosystem. Officers will be elected from all divisions but will be very limited to maintain a flat structure. These officers will be rewarded with additional voting rights and compensation.

Once a decentralized voting system has been developed The Foundation will adopt the system for leadership voting, project focuses, organizational structure, member voting rights dispersal, and other proposals.

## Tools and Projects

Foundation tools will be integral parts of larger projects. The tools will be results of the initial member bounties (offline signing tool, educational materials, community group strategy, etc). The claimants of bounties will become members and work together to combine tools in the development of projects.

Projects will be focused on expanding utility in ChiaLisp based blockchains (decentralized voting system, auxillary node, ChiaLisp workshops, etc). Each project will have one or more lead that is responsible for project progress, incentivizing project team members, and working with other leads to combine efforts.

## Tokenomics / Governance

Tokens are divided into two main groups: member and patron.

Four types of member tokens will ensure that members receive role specific compensation: each member will receive 1 general member token, each lead will receive 1 lead member token, each officer will receive 1 officer token, and each founder will receive 1 founder token. A verified member token grants the user 2 shares for member compensation and 2 votes. A verified lead token grants the user 3 shares for member compensation and 3 votes. A verified officer token grants the user 5 shares for member compensation and 5 votes. A verified founder token grants the user 1 share for member compensation and 1 vote, founder voting shares are considered standard member voting shares and do not include any additional authority.
To ensure The Foundation can expand with the community, all member tokens (except for founder tokens) will use a multi-issuance TAIL allowing for additional tokens to be minted as needed to on-board members.

Three types of patron tokens will ensure that members receive compensation directly correlated to their contributions: general patron tokens will be divided equally amongst all members based on their compensation shares with a portion held in reserve for use by The Foundation as a whole, bounty patron tokens will be divided equally amongst claimants of bounties, and project patron tokens will be divided equally amongst the specified project members based on their compensation shares. General patron tokens will be released in sets with each set created from one-time-mint TAILs. Bounty patron tokens will be minted in sets with each set representing an active bounty minted with a one-time-mint TAIL, any bounty patron tokens remaining upon bounty completion will be burned by The Foundation. Project patron tokens will also be released in sets with each set representing a project and minted with a one-time-mint TAIL, project patron tokens will remain available until all are distributed.

All tokens will need to be verified for access to member or patron benefits. For the first year this process will require the recipient to burn the token and provide proof of burn. A common burn address will be designated to ensure that all tokens are properly burned. Proof of burn will require users to sign the coin ID of the burnt Token with a private key that corresponds to the public key which burned the token.

Proof of burn will be redeemable for limited NFTs based on the initial token (ex. offline signing bounty patron token burns are redeemable for offline signing tool NFTs). The general patron token NFTs will be based on the token set that was burned.

## Voting

One of The Foundations initial projects will be to build a decentralized voting system, until this is complete voting will be conducted with currently available web2 methods. Voting rights are granted to members that verify their tokens based on their role. Requirements for a vote to pass are based on the proposal:

Bounty proposals - simple majority
Project proposals - simple majority
Member approvals - simple majority
Member removals - complete majority
Organizational structure proposals - complete majority
Member compensation adjustments - complete majority

In addition to the above, projects and divisions may choose to include their own voting systems but all votes are subject to veto by a complete majority of leads and officers.
