## About the Founders

### ClydeWallace22 (Brandt) -

With 12 years experience leading teams in high-tech industries; Clyde is passionate about creating robust organizational frameworks that are sustainable, efficient, and value driven. Clyde has administered a $5 billion budget with Charter Communications, written FCC whitepapers to define broadband propagation mapping standards, and spoken as the legislative expert on a Durango Tech-Knowledge UAV (Drone) panel. Clyde's background working within diverse industries alongside governments, consumers, and developers enables him to establish organizational structures that enhance associate engagement, ensure sustainability, and encourage community involvement.

Clyde began following the Chia Network^tm^ shortly before transactions went live on mainnet and quickly began farming 175TB. To better understand ChiaLisp, the on-chain programming language, Clyde developed the Rhizosphere IDE. Rhizosphere is an open-source python based IDE for which Clyde was a finalist in the Sirius Labs hackathon. Most recently Clyde has been working as Chief Operating Officer of xch.gallery, the first NFT marketplace live on Chia Testnet10.

It is Clyde's vision that The XCH Foundation evolves to become fully operated and managed by the community. The Foundation ideally will develop open source tooling, educational materials, and industry partnerships to expand utility of ChiaLisp based PoST blockchains. Clyde believes the adaptable framework he developed for The Foundation ensures this vision and lays the groundwork for advancing utility within the ecosystem. Clyde can be reached on Discord, Keybase, Twitter, and Github.

### Drose (Dylan) -

Dylan brings passion and energy to the foundation. For the last 7 years Dylan has focused on commercializing new technology through his own startups, University of Washington EE labs, and new ideas at Amazon. He has lead teams, built out prototypes and supply chains, and understands how to bring cutting edge technology to everyday people. Dylan strives to bring people with a variety of skills and experiences into Chia's development community, and believes in expanding opportunities to contribute to Chia at this early stage.

Dylan got involved with Chia after starting his own plug and play mining business on Ethereum. He was fascinated by the opportunity to bring the power of crypto into an easy to use form factor and believed that Chia was the crypto currency to make that happen. Dylan ran a small batch of prototypes for the Evergreen miner, a plug and play Chia farming device that includes a mobile app, pre-plotted drives, and a farmer/wallet server. After a successful first batch, Dylan decided to prepare for a new wave of adoption by scaling out a supply Chain and redesigning the software around scalability, security, and upgradeability. When he's not building Evergreen OS, he is helping people setup large Chia farms, hosting the Chia Happy hour, and spreading the gospel (mainly on Twitter)

Dylan wants to build a decentralized organization that is built by and for the community. The Foundation will act as a hub for consumers and businesses learn about Chia, get started as a farmer or developer, and meet other people who share a passion for technology. Dylan enjoys bringing people together to work on Chia ideas and believe the Foundation can be a bridge for these activities to happen. Dylan can be reached on Twitter.

## XCH Foundation Overview

The XCH Foundation is designed as a flat organization with a focus on attracting new Members, encouraging current member participation, and eliciting community feedback. The Foundation structure will consist of three layers: Members, leads, and officer.

### Member
To become a member, users must complete an approved proof-of-human-work (PoH) activity. Initial PoH activities will consist of bounties designed to attract developers, designers, community managers, operations leaders, etc. Members will be responsible for working on community tools, projects, and educational materials. Members receive not only a base level compensation from General CAT's sold but also a bonus compensation for Project CAT's sold that relate to their projects. In addition, each verified Member token can be redeemed for 1 custom designed Member NFT. During the first year, The Foundation will operate in a trusted setup phase during which the Founders will approve Members and appoint leadership. Any and all Members, including Leads and Officers, can be removed from the organization for lack of participation (determined based on compensations from project CAT's or complete majority Member vote), violating community rules (determined by complete majority Member vote), or illegal activity (determined by local or national authorities).

### Lead
After the first year, Lead positions will become available as Foundation Members approve new projects. These project approvals will indicate the Lead of the project and will be proposed by Members (Leads and Officers are restricted from voting for Leads) using decentralized voting mechanisms secured by the Chia blockchain.  Leads will be responsible for overseeing project completion, incentivizing Members, and recommending new projects to be completed. One lead may responsible for multiple projects or there may be multiple leads associated with a single project. Leads will be elected by Members from all divisions (developers, designers, community managers, etc) and will be rewarded with additional compensation and a custom designed Lead NFT for their efforts.

#### Overseeing Project Completion
Leads will be responsible for providing, communicating, and enforcing timelines. During the project proposal stage, prospective Lead(s) will provide a rough timeline of the project. If the project proposal is approved by the Members the prospective Lead(s) communicate the projects adherence to or deviations from the provided timeline. Lead(s) have methods to incentivize members which will help to enforce timelines.

#### Incentivizing Members
Leads will determine the distribution of Project CAT profits to Members working on the designated project.
There is a maximum limit to the amount that the Lead can receive based on shares of members working on the project.

#### Recommending New Projects
Leads will recommend future projects they would like to oversee or have developed by the community but members will be responsible for submitting and approving project proposals.

### Officer
After the first year, officers will be elected by the Members (Leads and Officers are restricted from voting for Officers) using decentralized voting mechanisms secured by the Chia blockchain. Officers will be responsible for overseeing the direction of The Foundation, incentivizing leads, and interacting with other organizations in the ecosystem. The main focus for Officers to complete the tasks that enable their Leads and Members to work without worrying about the  Officers will be elected from all divisions but will be very limited to maintain a flat structure. These officers will be rewarded with additional voting rights, compensation, and a custom designed Officer NFT for their efforts.

Once a decentralized voting system has been developed The Foundation will adopt the system for leadership voting, project focuses, organizational structure, member voting rights dispersal, and other proposals.

#### Overseeing Foundation Direction
Officers will ensure that projects and divisions are working synchronously and have aligned goals. This extends to working with Leads to ensure timelines are kept or updated to be more accurate, helping Leads talk with non-participatory Members, and directing treasury funds to where they are needed.

#### Incentivizing Leads
Officers have the ability to direct treasury funds as needed to incentivize leads and their teams to remain on timeline. Officers also have a limit on the funds that can be distributed to themselves or other officers.

#### Interacting with other Organizations
Officers are responsible for forming and maintaining strategic partnerships within the ecosystem to further Foundation goals. These partnerships will need to be approved by Members if there is an associated financial or labor obligation on the part of the Foundation.

## Tools and Projects

### Tools
Foundation tools will be integral parts of larger projects. The tools will be results of the initial member bounties (offline signing tool, educational materials, community group strategy, etc). The claimants of bounties will become Members and work together to combine tools in the development of projects.

Tools will generally be the object of bounties that yield member tokens to the claimant.

### Projects
Projects will be focused on expanding utility in ChiaLisp based blockchains (decentralized voting system, auxiliary node, ChiaLisp workshops, etc). Each project will have one or more lead that is responsible for project progress, incentivizing project team Members, and working with other leads to combine efforts.

Projects are submitted and approved by Foundation Members.

## Tokenomics / Governance

Tokens are divided into two main groups: member and patron.

### Member Tokens
Four types of member tokens will ensure that Members receive role specific compensation: each member will receive 1 general member token, each lead will receive 1 lead member token, each officer will receive 1 officer token, and each founder will receive 1 founder token. A verified member token grants the user 2 shares for member compensation and 2 votes. A verified lead token grants the user 3 shares for member compensation and 2 votes. A verified officer token grants the user 5 shares for member compensation and 5 votes. A verified founder token grants the user 1 share for member compensation and 1 vote, founder voting shares are considered standard member voting shares and do not include any additional authority.
To ensure The Foundation can expand with the community, all member tokens (except for founder tokens) will use a multi-issuance TAIL allowing for additional tokens to be minted as needed to on-board Members.

### Patron Tokens
Three types of patron tokens will ensure that Members receive compensation directly correlated to their contributions: general patron tokens will be divided equally amongst all Members based on their compensation shares with a portion held in reserve for use by The Foundation as a whole, bounty patron tokens will be divided equally amongst claimants of bounties, and project patron tokens will be divided equally amongst the specified project Members based on their compensation shares. General patron tokens will be released in sets with each set created from one-time-mint TAILs. Bounty patron tokens will be minted in sets with each set representing an active bounty minted with a one-time-mint TAIL, any bounty patron tokens remaining upon bounty completion will be burned by The Foundation. Project patron tokens will also be released in sets with each set representing a project and minted with a one-time-mint TAIL, project patron tokens will remain available until all are distributed.

### Token Verification
All tokens will need to be verified for access to member or patron benefits. For the first year this process will require the recipient to burn the token and provide proof of burn. A common burn address will be designated to ensure that all tokens are properly burned. Proof of burn will require users to sign the coin ID of the burnt Token with a private key that corresponds to the public key which burned the token.

### Future Benefits
Proof of burn will be redeemable for limited NFTs based on the initial token (ex. offline signing bounty patron token burns are redeemable for offline signing tool NFTs). The general patron token NFTs will be based on the token set that was burned.

## Voting

One of The Foundations initial projects will be to build a decentralized voting system, until this is complete voting will be conducted with currently available web2 methods. Voting rights are granted to Members that verify their tokens based on their role. Requirements for a vote to pass are based on the proposal:

Bounty proposals - simple majority
Project proposals - simple majority
Member approvals - simple majority
Member removals - complete majority
Organizational structure proposals - complete majority
Member compensation adjustments - complete majority

In addition to the above, projects and divisions may choose to include their own voting systems but all votes are subject to veto by a complete majority of leads and officers.
